Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ AI agents are about to get REALLY interesting. By 2027, we're looking at some major shifts. Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects might get the axe due to costs, but on the flip side, we're potentially entering a new era of computing with AI systems 1000x more powerful than GPT-4!

AI agents are predicted to reshape SaaS product development, from brainstorming to launch. We could see hundreds of thousands of AI research assistants deployed internally and a significant increase in enterprise adoption. But, it's not all sunshine; expect growing concerns about security. ðŸ˜¬

So, with all these changes, what skills do you think will be most valuable for developers navigating this AI-powered future?

Let's chat in the comments! ðŸ‘‡
